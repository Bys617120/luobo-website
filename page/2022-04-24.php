    <h2>Reading Is Valuable</h2>
    I love books very much.Reading is valuable in many ways.Firstly,through reading,I can get to know the writers' thoughts and feelings that the writers convey in books.Secondly,I can learn about the writing styles of many foreign writers by reading some translations. Besides,reading can help me solve many difficult problems and get me out of trouble.Whenever I feel sad for falling the exams,reading helps me transform bad moods into joy and courage.
    <br/>All in all,I benefit a lot from reading,which makes me a better person.I think books are the best gifts that God has given me
